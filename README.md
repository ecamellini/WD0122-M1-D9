# What are the main tools in our toolbox

## What are the concepts that we covered, basics of programming

1. Variables -- to store data, that can change overtime
2. Data-types -- what can your data be?
   1. Basic data-types: string, nubmer, null, undefined, boolean
   2. Structural data-types: arrays to store oredered collections of items, objects to represent a set of key-value properties
3. Control flow -- choose what your program does and when
   1. If statement: choose if to execute some instructions or not, based on some condition
   2. Loops (while, for): execute the same instructions many times
4. Functions -- reuse code, make it parametric --> you define a block of code, some inputs (parameters), it gives back some output (return value)
